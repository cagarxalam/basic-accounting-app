Hi Aleksi,

I've checked your images. And have figured out your problems, I think the text box goes widens and offscreen because there is a bug on your javascript files. I can fix your js files, so your box won't widen anymore. I have attached a webpage that I've made that has a text box. And it doesn't widen and offscreen on my page.

Feel free to contact me if you're interested.

Thanks,
Bayu
